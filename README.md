# TMA4300-CompStat
Projects for course TMA4300 Computer Intensive Statistical Methods

* The first project (`BerStat1`) entails simulation methods from distribution
* The second project (`BerStat2`) is about implementing a MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) sampler and comparing to the `R-INLA`-package.
* The third project (`BerStat3`) entails bootstrapping, permutation tests and the EM-algorithm (expectation maximization algorithm).

All projects done in collaboration with Jostein A. Aanes
